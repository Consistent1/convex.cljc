# `:module/bench`

While the [core Java repository](https://github.com/Convex-Dev/convex)
offers some benchmarks, the tooling in this Clojure monorepo alongside the
[Criterium library](https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium) make it really
convenient benchmarking various aspects of the Convex stack.

This module is aimed for core Convex developers mostly and will grow over time.
Currently, it starts by benchmarking various Ed25519 implementations.
