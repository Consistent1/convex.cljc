# Project 'Dev'

This project simply holds a `user` namespace (loaded by default by Clojure) which tries to require
a `dev` namespace. The `$.dev` namespace is a template which requires all namespaces defined throughout
all this repository. It can conveniently be copied as that `dev` namespace alongside `user` and be used
privatly for accessing anything in this repository.
